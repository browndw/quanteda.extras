\title{Calculate collocational associations by Mutual Information}
\usage{
collocates_by_MI(
  target_tkns,
  node_word,
  left = 5,
  right = 5,
  statistic = c("pmi", "pmi2", "pmi3", "npmi")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{target_tkns}{The target quanteda tokens object.}

\item{node_word}{The token of interest.}

\item{left}{How many words a span should extend to the left of the node word.}

\item{right}{How many words a span should extend to the right of the
node word.}

\item{statistic}{The type of mutual information to calculate. One of "pmi"
(default), "pmi2", "pmi3", or "npmi".}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing absolute frequencies and Mutual Information
calculations.
}
\description{
A function for calculating point-wise mutual information
from quanteda tokens.
The function requires:
\itemize{
\item a tokens object
\item a node word to search for
\item a window counting to the left
\item a window counting to the right
So \code{collocates_by_MI(my_tokens, "test", 5, 5)} would look for collocates
words to the left and 5 words to the right of the word "test".
}
}
\examples{
\donttest{
library(quanteda)
texts <- c("The big cat sat on the mat",
           "The big cat ran very fast",
           "The big cat likes to hunt mice")
toks <- tokens(texts)
result <- collocates_by_MI(toks, "cat", left = 1, right = 1)
head(result)
}
}
