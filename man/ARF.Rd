\title{Average reduced frequencies for all tokens in a corpus
ARF calculates average reduced frequency, which combines dispersion and
frequency into a single measure. It does this by de-emphasizing occurrences
that appear clustered in close proximity.}
\usage{
ARF(target_tkns)
}
\arguments{
\item{target_tkns}{The target quanteda tokens object.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing average reduced frequency for each token.
}
